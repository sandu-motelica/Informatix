      <section id="purpose">
        <h3><span>1.1</span> Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          This document aims to define the software requirements for the
          "Informatix" project, an innovative web application designed to
          facilitate high school students' learning of programming through
          problem-solving activities. The scope of this document encompasses the
          description of the product and its functionalities, ensuring clarity
          regarding the objectives and features of the system.

      <section id="scope">
        <h3><span>1.2</span> Scope</h3>
        <p>
          The software under specification is a web application designed to
          facilitate programming learning for high school students. Its primary
          purpose is to provide a platform where students can solve programming
          problems, proposed and curated by teachers. The application allows
          teachers to create classes, enroll students, assign problems as
          assignments, and evaluate students' submissions. Students can solve
          problems, submit solutions for evaluation, comment on problems, and
          rate them. Additionally, the application offers an API for seamless
          integration with other web applications and supports the export/import
          of problems in various open formats. The overarching goal of the
          software is to enhance programming skills among high school students
          through interactive problem-solving activities, fostering
          collaboration and knowledge sharing within a structured educational
          environment.

        <h3><span>2.1</span> Product Perspective</h3>

        The web application described in this SRS stands as an independent
        product tailored specifically for the educational domain, focusing on
        programming learning for high school students. While it functions as a
        standalone platform, it can also be integrated into larger educational
        systems or platforms. This application is not a replacement for existing
        systems but rather serves as a complementary tool to enhance the
        learning experience in programming-related subjects. It provides a novel
        approach to learning by engaging students in problem-solving activities
        under the guidance of their teachers. In the context of a larger
        educational ecosystem, this software interfaces with existing learning
        management systems, student information systems, and other educational
        platforms. It provides seamless integration through its API, allowing
        data exchange and interoperability with external systems. Below is a
        simplified diagram illustrating the major components of the overall
        system:
