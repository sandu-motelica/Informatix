      <section id="scope">
        <h3><span>1.2</span> Scope</h3>
        <p>
          The software under specification is a web application designed to
          facilitate programming learning for high school students. Its primary
          purpose is to provide a platform where students can solve programming
          problems, proposed and curated by teachers. The application allows
          teachers to create classes, enroll students, assign problems as
          assignments, and evaluate students' submissions. Students can solve
          problems, submit solutions for evaluation, comment on problems, and
          rate them. Additionally, the application offers an API for seamless
          integration with other web applications and supports the export/import
          of problems in various open formats. The overarching goal of the
          software is to enhance programming skills among high school students
          through interactive problem-solving activities, fostering
          collaboration and knowledge sharing within a structured educational
          environment.

          Developers need to consider various factors while building the
          application. These include adhering to regulatory policies like GDPR
          for user data protection, implementing robust security measures
          against common threats, designing a scalable architecture to handle
          potential user growth, ensuring cross-browser compatibility and
          accessibility, and providing documentation and ongoing support for
          maintenance. Additionally, they must focus on data validation, API
          design for interoperability, performance optimization, and error
          handling for a seamless user experience.

        <p>
          Technologies used in implementation of the project are HTML5, CSS3,
          JavaScript (frontend). The backend development relies on the Node.js
          ecosystem, including libraries (like JWT) and package management tools
          (like npm). We plan to use PostgreSQL database. PostgreSQL is known
          for its reliability, performance, and robust feature set, making it a
          popular choice for both small-scale applications and large-scale
          enterprise systems.
